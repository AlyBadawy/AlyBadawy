# Aly Badawy

### 👋 Hi There

I'm Aly Badawy (He/Him), a seasoned senior software and embedded systems engineer hailing from Wayne, NJ. My true passion lies in crafting versatile software solutions for web, mobile, desktop, and firmware for embedded systems.

My journey began in Cairo, Egypt, where my affinity for computers sparked at an early age. I penned my inaugural program in BASIC at the tender age of twelve. As high school beckoned, I ventured into creating my first graphical user interface application using Visual Basic.

My college days witnessed the birth of a software development forum, an arena for vibrant discussions among fellow developers. This venture introduced me to an array of technologies like ASP.net, PHP, and databases, propelling me to forge ahead with both web and desktop application creation.

Zooming ahead to 2007, I embarked on a transcontinental journey to the United States. There, I dived headlong into mastering over ten distinct programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby, C++, C#, JAVA, Rails, Swift, Perl, VB.net, SQL, and Go. My explorations also encompassed the intricate realm of Linux operating systems. I also earned my masters degree in Information Systems in 2010.

Between 2014 and 2018, I proudly co-founded Fourteen Inch LLC, a nimble software development firm. We designed frameworks and solutions tailored to a diverse clientele. Throughout this phase, I orchestrated the entire development lifecycle, spanning technical analysis, backend coding, test scripting, and CI/CD implementation.

In the present day, I'm a dedicated member of Steampunk, Inc., a preeminent software development enterprise specializing in crafting solutions for the US government.

Beyond my ardor for software engineering, I delight in designing embedded systems (ARM-based) and crafting intricate low-voltage electronic circuits. I also enjoy coding for AVR, and STM32 microcontrollers, designing PCBs, and even delving into the realm of 3D modeling.
