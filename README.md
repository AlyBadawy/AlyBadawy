# Aly Badawy

### 👋 Hi There

Hi. My name is Aly Badawy (He/Him). I am a senior software engineer from Wayne, NJ; and I love building web services for different purposes.

I was born in Cairo, Egypt. Since I was young, I have been working with computers. I wrote my first program when I was twelve years old, in BASIC. During  High school, I wrote my first GUI application in Visual Basic.



While attending college, I started a forums website to disucss software development with other developers, it was there where I was exposed to many technologies like ASP.net, php, and databases, I, then, started creating web applications besides desktop-applications.

Fast-forward to 2007, when I migrated to the united states, I took a plunge and learned over ten different programming languages and frameworks (Ruby, C++, C#, JAVA, Rails, Swift, Perl, VB.net, SQL, Go). I also digged into Linux operating systems.

From 2014 to 2018, I was the co-founder of a small software development company (Fourteen Inch LLC) that built frameworks and solutions for clients with a wide-range of requirements. I was then responsible for most of the lifecycle for the development, from technical analysis and design, coding the back-end, writing tests, and CI/CD scripts.

I Currently work for Steampunk, Inc. - a software development company that specializes in building software for the US goverment.

Beside my passion for software engineering, I also enjoy building low-voltage electronic ciruits, code for AVR microcontrollers, and 3D modeling.
